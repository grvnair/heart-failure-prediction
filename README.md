# heart-failure-prediction

Being a Data Science enthusiast, I was interested to see the use cases which Machine Learning has on the Health Care Sector. I explored the web and came across Heart Failure clinical records on UCI ML Repository. While exploring the dataset, I realised there was a need of a robust model that could evaluate the features and identify high-risk patients and take preventive measures. 

As this was a binary classification task to identify if the patient was a high risk patient, I compared different classification algorithms on their Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 Score. I started by analysing the data, and then trained and tested the models on Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. I used the Sci-kit learn library to implement and evaluate each algorithm. 

After testing all the algorithms, Logistic regression performed the best as compared to all other algorithms. It achieved  Accuracy - 0.8, Precision - 0.88, Recall - 0.6 and F1 Score - 0.71. 

After working on this project, I learned the importance of comparing and evaluating different algorithms across important metrics to get a robust and reliable model.
